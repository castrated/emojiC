# emojiC
the worst language of all time

## what on earth is this
at my job, my method of job security is to cast everything possible to pointers, leave very little whitespace, and not comment my code. a friend of mine jokingly suggested that i make it in emoji. unfortunately, i took it seriously.
i've developed a hand-written plan for converting the C Programming Language to emojiC. at the lower level, there will also be emojiASM. this means unicode memory addressing. if the address isn't emoji, the id will be merged until at lease one emoji prints. if there is a non-emoji remainder, Fs are added until it becomes a valid, non-used emoji series.

## why are you doing this
my programming philosophy is simple:
* make code secure
* make code fast
* make code cross-compatible
* make code functional

so long as it follows these rules, you don't need to make it look good, nor add comments. if people want to edit it, they already know how to.
adding emojis into the mix simply elevates this philosophy to the world of hieroglyphics.
